Terraform ECS Provisioning
==================

# Overview
* This module allows an ECS cluster and service to be spun up within a new VPC
and served using a load balancer. You'll need to have a keypair (variable: aws_key_pair)
and a [profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html) 
set in your aws config (variable: aws_profile)
* The entry point is main.tf and it processes the variables and goes through
each module setting up what you need for the cluster.
* All configuration is handled in the top level variables.tf file for
organizational purposes and can be set via an `*.tfvars` file. An
example app.tfvars file is included in this repo. Dynamically filled in 
variables are nested in the individual modules

# Commands
* To see how this would work without actually spinning anything up you can run:
```
# This only needs to be run once
terraform init

# This shows what would happen and applies the variables set in the app.tfvars file
terraform plan -var-file="app.tfvars"
```
* To run:
```
terraform apply -var-file="app.tfvars"
```
* To destroy
```
terraform destroy -var-file="app.tfvars"
```

# Deploying
* I would recommend using something like Jenkins to deploy. You'll want to
authenticate to aws and ecr, publish the built images to ECR then push
a task definition
* Part of this provisioning process pushes a task definition but that is meant
to be replaced and that is just a placeholder
